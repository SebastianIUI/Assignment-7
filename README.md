# Assignment-7

1. The purpose of this assignment was to design a program that would make a list of TV show names that ended prior to a given date (2020) and write to a new CSV file.
2. The program takes in the dataset via a direct pathway within the program and outputs the list of shows that ended before 2020. The program splices and indentifies the 'End Date' column then reads each shows end year and if it had ended before Janurary 3rd 2020 then it will be added to an empty list.
3. You use the program by inputting the dataset an allowing it to configure/manipiulate the dataset into excluding the shows that ended before the set end date.
